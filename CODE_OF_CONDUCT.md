# Py2Exe Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

This project is dedicated to producing high-quality, reliable software. This goal is best achieved through professional collaboration. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We expect all contributors to adhere to these standards to ensure a productive and respectful development environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive and professional environment include:

*   **Being Respectful:** Treat all contributors with professional courtesy. While technical debates and disagreements are a healthy part of development, they must never devolve into personal attacks.
*   **Being Constructive:** Focus criticism on code and ideas, not on individuals. When providing feedback, be clear, constructive, and considerate.
*   **Being Focused:** Keep discussions and contributions relevant to the project's goals.
*   **Taking Responsibility:** We all make mistakes. Acknowledge them and work collaboratively to find a solution. Strive for quality and maintainability in all contributions.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

*   The use of intimidating, derogatory, or harassing language or imagery.
*   Personal insults, trolling, or other unprofessional conduct.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
*   Submitting code or pull requests with the clear intent to disrupt the project.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer.

*   **Email for Reporting:** `devaux.mail@gmail.com`

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project maintainer has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project participants who do not follow these standards may be temporarily or permanently removed from the project at the discretion of the maintainer.
